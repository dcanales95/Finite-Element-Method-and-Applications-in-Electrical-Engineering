# Finite Element Method and Applications in Electrical Engineering

Finite element method (FEM) is a numerical technique used to compute appoximations of partial differential equations (PDEs). These equations typically arise in engineering and mathematical modeling to analyze and predict the behavior of a structure in a given physical phenomenon, such as heat transfer, mass transport, fluid flow, electromagnetics, and more.
